# 🌌 CodeVerse

> **Enter the Arena. Code your Destiny.**

CodeVerse is a futuristic, real-time competitive coding platform designed for 1v1 battles. It connects developers in a virtual arena where they can challenge opponents to solve algorithmic problems under time pressure. Featuring a sleek, glassmorphism-inspired UI and seamless real-time synchronization, CodeVerse transforms standard coding practice into an intense e-sport experience.

## ✨ Features

### ⚔️ **Real-Time Battle Arena**
* **1v1 Duels:** Create private rooms and invite friends using a unique Room Code.
* **Live Synchronization:** Powered by **Socket.io**, battle states (timers, scores, and submission verdicts) are synced instantly between players.
* **Dynamic Problem Set:** Fetches real coding problems from the **Codeforces API** (Ratings 800-1200) or uses a robust fallback set if the API is unavailable.

### 🚀 **Futuristic User Experience**
* **Immersive UI:** Custom particle background effects, neon aesthetics, and glassmorphism design.
* **Interactive Feedback:** Anime.js animations for smooth transitions and alerts.
* **Live Leaderboard:** Real-time tracking of solved problems and penalties during the match.

### 🛠 **Backend Systems**
* **JSON-Based Persistence:** Lightweight, file-based database system for users, battles, and leaderboards (no external database setup required).
* **Automated Judging Simulation:** Simulates a judging environment where submissions are verified against Codeforces user status (polling mechanism).
